The data is downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis script performs the following

Reads X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the working directory/UCI HAR folder and stores them in  objects: TrainData, TrainLabel and TrainSubject variables respectively.
Reads X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt from the working directory/UCI HAR  folder and stores them in  objects :TestData, TestLabel and Testsubject variables respectively.
Combines objects TestData to TrainData to generate a Traintestdata  data frame,  combines TestLabel to TrainLabel to generate Traintestlabel data frame,combines TestSubject to trainSubject to generate Traintestsubject data frame.
Reads the features.txt file from the working directory/UCI HAR  folder and stores the data in a variable called features.
Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. this results in a data frame meanstddev with o Rows and 66 columns.
Read the activity_labels.txt file from the working directory/UCI HAR folder and stores the data in a variable called Activities.
uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Combines the Traintestsubject,Traintestlabels,Traintestdata into one data frame"combined data" that has the subjects(1-30) and 6 activities given descriptive names such as standing,walking etc.
Creates a second independent tidy data set(tidy with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.the tidy dataset dimensions are 180 rows representing the per subject(30) per activity(6) and 68columns.
Writes out the  the tidy dataset to tidy.txt in the working directory.
